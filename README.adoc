*A Set of general-purpose Tools, Utilities, and Data Structures for Comfortable Development*

These tools prioritize speed and ease of development over strict efficiency or full compliance with Go philosophy.
They accelerate development and enhance the experience, by reducing the cognitive load,
making them well suited for rapid prototyping.

There is a very nice library https://github.com/charbz/gophers[github.com/charbz/gophers].
Its API is a mix of mutable and immutable operations, which can be confusing.
Most of the methods there do return a new collection instance though. This has its applications,
but at the same time it presents some inconveniences when working with extensive amount of
other libraries that expect mutable elements.
